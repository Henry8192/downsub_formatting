you're on the back deck with a cold

drink grilling up a dead animal when it

hits you did you forget to pick up the

kids no you forgot the tech news you

don't even have kids or a deck whose

grill is this in its q2 earnings call

intel sheepishly admitted it's

completely giving up on optane when

asked about it by tom's hardware ceo pat

gelsinger beat around the bush saying we

continue to rationalize our portfolio in

support of our idm 2.0 strategy this

includes evaluating divesting businesses

that are either not sufficiently

profitable or are not core to our

strategic objectives truly a great

eulogy if i've ever heard one optane

memory had been used to create storage

and memory products since 2015 but they

discontinued consumer ssds in january

2021 to focus on enterprise products

like persistent ram for data centers

and i guess the team didn't even know

because just last week they showed off

initial tests of their new ddr5 obtained

modules which carried the foreboding

code name crowspass

they're passed now as gelsinger pointed

out in the call this marks the sixth

non-core intel business that he's either

sold or shuttered since taking on the

role of ceo in february 2021 including

selling intel's drone business to elon

musk's brother kimball a few weeks ago

gelsinger has not yet commented whether

he plans to don a long black robe and

scythe to future quarterly earnings

calls

and more intel news their foray into

dedicated graphics has apparently come

at the expense of support for their

integrated gpus through a post on the

intel support forums it was announced

that integrated graphics from their 6th

generation skylake cpus all the way to

ice lake would be moved into their

legacy support model which is the driver

equivalent of that scene from toy story

2 where andy gets buzz lightyear and no

longer wants to play with woody

integrated graphics are woody i don't

want to play with you anymore amd might

have just doxxed their starting lineup

for the new am5 socketed ryzen 7000

processors according to video cards the

ryzen 9 7950x and 7900x

ryzen 7 700x and ryzen 5 7600x were all

tagged in the marketing resource file

for ryzen pro cpu

mysteriously absent were the ryzen 7 70

800 x and any mention of a ryzen 3 cpu

but only starting with four processors

really keeps with the ninja turtles

theme of the 7000 series with am5 no

longer on the horizon but instead

hanging just out of reach like some sort

of cruel cpu pinata is it time we ask

ourselves if we actually need that much

computer

at computex back in may amd shared

benchmarks of some rafael cpus and let

the world know to expect processors that

use 170 watt tdps and it appears these

ryzen 9s are the processors they were

referring to since nvidia's upcoming

4000 series of gpus are already expected

to be guzzling back double the amount of

juicy delicious electrons as their 3000

series counterparts this could be

setting a dangerous precedent for gaming

pcs where power efficiency takes a back

seat to

well everything else your next

beautifully ray tracing 8k 200 fps

minecraft machine

could spend as much energy punching

virtual dirt for an hour as an electric

kettle used to quench the thirst of 75

tea addicted british ditch diggers

what earlier this week russia announced

they were done with the international

space station as soon as their

cooperation agreement was up in 2024 but

now they're saying i guess it's good

enough until we get our own russia space

agency ross cosmos has indicated that

they wish to remain in the cooperative

agreement until their own orbital

outpost named ross is completed

estimates for this happening are

sometime around 2028 quickly followed by

the launch of course of their next space

stations phoebe chandler monica joey and

one that's always really cold you can

see them through her shirt

a mechanical engineer from virginia tech

found that by coupling a retractive

adhesive with a pneumatically controlled

membrane they were able to create a

glove that mimics an octopuses gripping

abilities finally

the octoglove yes that's the real name

was demonstrated to be able to grip

things like metals acrylic and even

plates and spoons all while under water

just in case you've been hankering to

finally have a picnic under the sea it

has unfortunately not yet been designed

for people with eight fingers

and going from handware to neckwear

manchester city football club has

launched a pilot program for a biometric

scarf that can gauge its fans emotions

partnering with emotibit and cisco the

connected scarf measures things like

heart rate movement sweat levels and

temperature if they really wanted to

know how fans felt though all they'd

really need to do is include a

breathalyzer am i right i'm british

amazon announced that they will no

longer be offering their amazon drive
